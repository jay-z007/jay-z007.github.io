- name: OpenBCI motion simulation
  duration: Jun 2016 - Apr 2017
  description:  Built an application that classifies the direction of motion based on the EEG waves emitted by the brain using python and scikit-learn. Can be used to move wheelchairs for physically challenged people. Used Power Spectral density for feature extraction and PCA for dimensionality reduction of features. OpenBCI system was used to record the EEG waves, laplacian and bandpass filters were used to preprocess the signal. Technology and Concepts - Python, Scikit-learn, OpenBCI, Laplacian filter, Power Spectral Density, PCA
